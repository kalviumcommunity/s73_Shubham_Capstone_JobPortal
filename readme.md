 Capstone Project Idea Brief
**Title**: Job Portal Web Application Using MERN Stack  
**Overview**:  
The Job Portal is a web-based platform designed to connect job seekers and employers. Job seekers can register, create profiles, upload resumes, search for jobs, and apply to listings, while employers can post job openings, review applications, and manage their postings. The project will leverage the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to build a full-stack application with features like user authentication, file uploads, and a responsive frontend.  

**Key Features**:  
- **User Roles**: Two types of users—job seekers and employers—with role-based access.  
- **Authentication**: Username/password login with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for security.  
- **Job Management**: Employers can create, update, and delete job listings; job seekers can browse and apply.  
- **Resume Upload**: Job seekers can upload resumes stored on the server.  
- **Search Functionality**: Filter jobs by title, location, or keywords.  
- **Frontend**: Responsive React-based UI with components for login, job listings, and profiles.  
- **Backend**: RESTful APIs built with Express.js and MongoDB for data storage.  

**Tech Stack**:  
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, job listings, and applications.  
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for API development.  
- **React**: Frontend library for building interactive UI components.  
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime for handling logic and file uploads.  

**Unique Aspect**:  
A simple job recommendation system that suggests jobs to seekers based on keywords in their resumes (optional stretch goal).  

**Objective**:  
To demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development using MERN, covering concepts like database schemas, API development, frontend design, authentication, and deployment, as outlined in the capstone track.

#### Daily Plan with Timelines
Below is a 15-day plan to get you started on the project, covering initial setup, core development, and some advanced features. You can adjust the timeline based on your pace, but this keeps it realistic and aligned with the capstone concepts.

- **Day 1: Project Setup and Planning**  
  - **Tasks**: Set up GitHub repo with README, install Node.js/npm, create `backend` and `frontend` folders, initialize with `npm init` and `create-react-app`.  
  - **Deliverable**: GitHub repo link with basic structure. 
Time :- 1 hr

- **Day 2: Design Wireframes**  
  - **Tasks**: Sketch low-fidelity wireframes (login, job list, profile pages) and create high-fidelity mockups using Figma or a similar tool.  
  - **Deliverable**: Screenshots of designs in repo.  
  - **Time**: 2 hours.  

- **Day 3: Backend Server Setup**  
  - **Tasks**: Set up Express.js server, connect to MongoDB (local or Atlas), and test with a basic endpoint (`GET /`).  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with server code.  
  - **Time**: 2-3 hours.  

- **Day 4: Database Models**  
  - **Tasks**: Define MongoDB schemas for `User` and `Job`, establish relationships (e.g., employer to jobs).  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with model files.  
  - **Time**: 3-4hours.  

- **Day 5: Authentication APIs**  
  - **Tasks**: Build `/register` and `/login` endpoints with JWT and password hashing (bcrypt).  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with auth routes.  
  - **Time**: 3-4  hours.  

- **Day 6: Job APIs (GET/POST)**  
  - **Tasks**: Create `GET /jobs` to list jobs and `POST /jobs/create` for employers to add jobs, with auth middleware.  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with job routes.  
  - **Time**: 3-4 hours.  

- **Day 7: Job APIs (PUT/DELETE)**  
  - **Tasks**: Add `PUT /jobs/:id` and `DELETE /jobs/:id` endpoints for updating/deleting jobs.  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with update/delete routes.  
  - **Time**: 3-4 hours.  

- **Day 8: Frontend - Login/Register**  
  - **Tasks**: Build React components for login and registration, connect to backend APIs.  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with login/register UI.  
  - **Time**: 4-5 hours.  

- **Day 9: Frontend - Job Listings**  
  - **Tasks**: Create a job listing page fetching data from `GET /jobs`, style to match hi-fi design.  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with job list UI.  
  - **Time**: 4-5 hours.  

- **Day 10: File Upload (Resume)**  
  - **Tasks**: Add backend route for resume upload using `multer`, integrate with frontend profile form.  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with file upload feature.  
  - **Time**: 4-5 hours.  

- **Day 11: Frontend - Update/Delete Jobs**  
  - **Tasks**: Add buttons and forms in React to edit/delete jobs, connect to PUT/DELETE APIs.  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with update/delete UI.  
  - **Time**: 3-4 hours.  

- **Day 12: Testing**  
  - **Tasks**: Write 5+ Jest tests for API endpoints (e.g., GET /jobs, POST /jobs/create).  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with test files.  
  - **Time**: 4-5 hours.  

- **Day 13: Dockerization**  
  - **Tasks**: Create a Dockerfile for the backend, test locally with Docker.  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with Dockerfile and video demo.  
  - **Time**: 3-4 hours.  

- **Day 14: Deployment Prep**  
  - **Tasks**: Prepare backend for deployment (e.g., env vars), build React app for production.  
  - **Deliverable**: PR with deployment configs.  
  - **Time**: 3-4 hours.  

- **Day 15: Deploy and Finalize**  
  - **Tasks**: Deploy backend to Heroku/Render, frontend to Netlify/Vercel, test end-to-end functionality.  
  - **Deliverable**: Deployed URLs and final PR.  
  - **Time**: 4-5 hours.  

**Total Timeline**: 15 days (assuming 3-5 hours/day). If you need more time, you can stretch it to 20-25 days by adding buffer days for debugging or refinement.
